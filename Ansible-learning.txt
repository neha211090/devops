Ansible installation commands

Step 1:- Launch an AWS RedHat Linux 7 Instance 
Step 2 :- Login into the Linux instance by generatig key value pair and via ec2-user
Step3 - After login , run below commands to add a EPEL (Extra Packages for Enterprise Linux)third party repository to get packages for Ansible

       rpm -Uvh https://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/epel-release-latest-7.noarch.rpm
Install Ansible
       yum install ansible -y 
Check Ansible version
       ansible --version

Create a new user for ansible administration & grant admin access to user (Master and Slave)
useradd ansadmin
passwd ansadmin
# below command addes ansadmin to sudoers file. But strongly recommended to use "visudo" command if you are aware vi or nano editor. 
echo "ansadmin ALL=(ALL) ALL" >> /etc/sudoers

Using keybased authentication is advised. If you are still at learning stage use password based authentication (Master & Slave)
# sed command replaces "PasswordAuthentication no to yes" without editing file 
 sed -ie 's/PasswordAuthentication no/PasswordAuthentication yes/' /etc/ssh/sshd_config

Login as a ansadmin user on master and generate ssh key (Master)
ssh-keygen -t rsa

Copy keys onto all ansible client nodes (Master)
ssh-copy-id <target-server>

ex . vi /home/.ssh/authorized_keys
copy the value of puble key (above generated in master node) and paste here in slave node and save.


Update target servers information on /etc/ansible/hosts file (Master)
echo "<target server IP>" > /etc/ansible/hosts

cd /etc/ansible/hosts
sudo vi hosts
create a group in hosts file 
for eg 
[web]
paste hostname of slave node
copy the value of slave hostname and paste in hosts file on master node

Run below command on master node
ansible web -m ping

run below command to check /etc/hosts of slave file from master node
ansible web -a "cat /etc/hosts"
